# Statistical-Learning
This is a collection of my work done in the Statistical Learning course.

This is a repository for a MATH540 - Statistical Learning course. The research project goal was to investigate how changing softmax activation function in multi-class logistic regression to sigmoid function would affect the performance of the model. 

The project was done by Saniya Abushakimova.

## Toolset
For this project several toolsets were utilized:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- time
- sckiti.learn

## Contents
- `Preprocessing.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing.
- `Final_project_solution.ipynb` - Jupyther Notebook with Data exploration, training procedures and experiments.
- `Final_project_report.pdf` - Report (AAAI format) that contains description and results of the work done.
